            <li><b>FEATURE:</b> Sticker Prices → A new tag above the applied stickers now displays a calculated sticker price percentage. This SP% is depicted by the ratio of the item price difference to the total buff price (ask) of all stickers. This feature can be disabled in the popup (default: on).</li>
            <li><b>POPUP:</b> Completely reworked the logic behind the popup. It now also features a 'changelog' tab displaying the latest changes.</li>
            <li><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The extension is now able to detect and make use of the CSFloat API requests already sent by the website. This will allow many new possibilities in the future.</li>
            <li><b>TECH-STACK:</b> Building and deploying the extension is now done using webpack. This allows for a much cleaner codebase and easier development. Please refer to the new README for more information.</li>

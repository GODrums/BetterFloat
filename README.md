### Troubleshooting on Mozilla Firefox

In some cases, Firefox does not grant extensions the necessary permissions automatically. This can be fixed by following these steps:

1. Open the BetterFloat popup by clicking on the icon in the toolbar
2. Look for a warning symbol in the top bar of the popup
3. Click on the warning symbol and grant the necessary permissions in the newly opened popup of your browser
4. Open the BetterFloat popup again and check if the warning symbol is gone
5. If the warning symbol is still there, please report this issue in our Discord server

### Limitations of self-building

Due to cases of abuse and illegal activities, we explicitly forbid the use of our hosted services when building the extension from source. If you want to use all extension features, please set up your own servers or use the official extension from the Chrome Web Store or Mozilla Add-on Store.

### Installation

Prerequisites:

-   Node.js `>=18.16.0`
-   pnpm `>=8.15.0` or npm `>=9.5.0`
-   tsc `>=4.7.0`

Prepare your local setup via the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
# copy the example env file
cp example.env .env
# fill in the required values. To exit VIM use ':wq'
vim .env
```

### Building

Build the extension in development or production mode:

```bash
# development mode (Chrome or Firefox)
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:firefox
# production mode (Chrome or Firefox)
pnpm build
pnpm build:firefox
```

When working with multiple version, the build process may benefit from clean builds. This can be achieved by running the following command before building:

```bash
# careful, this will delete the build folder
pnpm clean
```

### Loading

The built extension will be located in the `build` folder. For each created subversion (browser and manifest version), there will be a seperate subfolder. Load that folder as unpacked extension in your browser or pack it first and then load the packed version

**Chrome:**

-   Go to `chrome://extensions` or `about:addons` and enable developer mode
-   Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `build/{version}` folder

**Firefox:**

-   Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
-   Click on "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the `build/{version}/manifest.json` file

### Contributing

To contribute to this project, create your own fork of the repository and submit a pull request.
Please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification (or an equivalent one) and make sure to format your code with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). This projects supports the following commands to control code quality:

```bash
pnpm format  # format with Biome, ALT+SHIFT+F in VSCode
pnpm lint  # runs Biome lint
```

Make sure to test your changes extensively on both browsers and include relevant results in your pull request.
